Prevents biofilm and protein fixation.<strong>Manual cleaning</strong>Performed in dedicated sink with <strong>low-foaming detergent</strong>.Use <strong>single-use brushes</strong> for lumens/valves; actuate valves to ensure detergent access.Soak/immerse fully; rinse thoroughly.Critical conditions: correct detergent concentration, contact time, fluid flow through all channels, brushing technique.<strong>Automated cleaning (EWD)</strong>Enclosed locked chamber prevents interruption.Sprays/pulsed flow contact all surfaces.<strong>All lumens connected</strong> to machine; flow monitoring by internal sensors.Reproducible and validated.<strong>Automated disinfection</strong>Low-temp <strong>chemical disinfectant</strong> (glutaraldehyde, OPA, peracetic acid, etc).<strong>Single-use</strong> strongly preferred; reuse = risk of reduced activity.Conditions: correct concentration, contact time, temperature; absence of protein/detergent residues (these inactivate disinfectant).<strong>Rinsing</strong>Rinse with <strong>treated water</strong> (reverse osmosis or equivalent).Water quality requirements: low TVC, TOC, conductivity, free of <em>Pseudomonas/Legionella</em>.<strong>Drying and storage</strong>External and internal drying critical.<strong>Controlled environment cabinets (BS EN 16442)</strong> validated to maintain microbiological safety.If not in such cabinets → must be reused within <strong>3 hours</strong>.Some sealed cassette systems validated for up to 7 days.</p><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3"><strong>Tracking &amp; Audit</strong></h3><p class="ml-4 mb-2"><strong>Track-and-trace systems mandatory</strong>:Auto-identification (barcodes/GS1/RFID).Must link <strong>patient ↔ scope ↔ cycle ↔ operator</strong>.<strong>Audit trail must include</strong>:Endoscope ID.Patient ID.Staff member (operator).Date/time, cycle data, EWD ID.Results of periodic testing/validation.<strong>Audit</strong>:Local self-audit (unit-level checks).External audits by inspectors (CQC).Failures → incident reporting and corrective action.</p><h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3"><strong>Part E: Testing Methods</strong></h2><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Provides detailed methodology for the tests referenced in Part D, harmonised with BS EN ISO 15883-4.</p><p><strong>Test Categories</strong>:</p><p class="ml-4 mb-2"><strong>Automatic control tests</strong>Verify correct function of cycle controls.Parameters (time, flow, pressure, detergent dosing) compared against independent calibrated instruments.<strong>Cleaning efficacy testsProcess challenge devices (PCDs)</strong> used to simulate worst-case soils.Test soils (protein, carbohydrate, blood surrogates) applied to devices.Acceptance = complete removal to below defined threshold.Residual protein detection: sensitive assays required (ninhydrin obsolete). Alternative methods: fluorometric/biochemical with detection limits &lt;1 µg.<strong>Microbiological testsRinse-water</strong>: tested for total viable counts (TVC), endotoxin, conductivity, TOC.Some microbiological cultures may take up to 28 days; interim risk assessment needed.Endotoxin test (LAL assay) may be applied to detect Gram-negative contamination.<strong>Chemical residual tests</strong>Detect carry-over of detergents/disinfectants (e.g. aldehydes, peracetic acid).Colourimetric or analytical chemical assays.Must confirm below harmful thresholds.<strong>Thermometric tests</strong>Used if thermal disinfection/self-disinfection steps included.Multiple probes placed in chamber and lumens to confirm target temperatures reached for required time.<strong>Test instrumentation</strong>All measurement equipment (flow meters, pressure gauges, probes) must be <strong>calibrated and traceable</strong> to national standards.</p><p><strong>Acceptance thresholds</strong> (examples – exam recall):</p><p class="ml-4 mb-2"><strong>Protein residues</strong>: as low as reasonably achievable, typically &lt;1 µg/cm².<strong>Water TVC</strong>: &lt;10 CFU/100 mL for final rinse.<strong>Endotoxin</strong>: &lt;0.25 EU/mL (if scopes for sterile body sites).<strong>Chemical residues</strong>: below toxicological thresholds (compound-specific).</p><p><strong>Documentation</strong>:</p><p class="ml-4 mb-2">Test results → validation reports.Signed by CP(D), reviewed by AE(D), microbiologist endorses microbiology tests.Records stored for life of the EWD.</p><p>✅ <strong>FRCPath exam angle</strong>:</p><p class="ml-4 mb-2">Be able to <strong>list and describe the decontamination steps and their conditions</strong>.Know the <strong>validation and revalidation test categories</strong>.Recall <strong>tracking &amp; audit requirements</strong> (linking patient to scope).Highlight <strong>microbiological relevance</strong>: preventing <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Mycobacterium</em>, and <strong>prion transmission</strong>.</p>
